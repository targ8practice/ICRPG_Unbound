# THE JOURNEY

## THE BEGINNING
Every character's journey starts at the beginning, and this time it's no different.  When you create your character there are a number of steps you must follow in order to fully flesh them out. 

1. Concept - What is your concept for your character, just think of a few simple words or phrases that sum up who they are
2. Bio Form - Depending on the campagin setting, there will be different Bio forms to choose from.  Each will offer different bonuses and penalties to your Stats & Effort and also you can choose a Racial Ability that they may offer
3. Stats, Effort & Starting Ability - At this point you will have EXPEREINCE to spend to show what your character is good at. The cost of each is as follows:
STATS - 1 point per increase (max 3 in a single STAT)
EFFORT - 1 point per increase (Max 2 in a SINGLE EFFORT)
ABILITY - 2 points per starting ability

You can only choose from Abilities with the STARTING TAG at this point

## THE MIDDLE

- Defeating an Encounter

At the end of the session, or during a LONG REST, you can spend the Experience in the following ways:

*When BOOSTING or Training, spend an amount of XP to determing how much EFFORT you are using to train. When you gain a number of Training points equal to the total amount you wish to BOOST by, you can that permanat BOOST to your chosen STAT, EFFORT, HEART or ABILITY
