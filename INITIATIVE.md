# INITIATIVE (PASS THE TORCH)

With the Pass the Torch method, every player rolls an Initiative check (D20 + DEX or WIS) against the TARGET. If an equal or greater than the total amount of players pass the check, they decide who goes first also known as **'Gaining the Torch’**. Otherwise, the GM will be the first to act.

>The Initiative check can be made EASY or HARD in the following ways:
>- The players ambush the Monsters
>- The Monsters ambush the players
>- Environmental  effects

When ever you **'Gain the Torch'**, you will have your turn, after which you will then **“Pass the Torch”** (Choose who goes next). The Torchbearer can choose another player or the GM. This cycle continues until every player and NPC have taken their turn.

> If the GM has multiple NPC's on the field, each NPC must have a chance to act before the round is over.

The last person who **Gained the Torch** this round decides who starts with the Torch on the start of the next round.

*Example Ability Milestone*

**Instinctive Reaction**: When you roll an Initiative check, you may add both your DEX and WIS stats to the roll. This will also count as 2 successes towards passing the 
check.

# Rough Draft

Initiative determines the order of turns during a scene. This is normally done with everyone (including the GM) rolling a D20 with the  highest going first then proceeding clockwise around the table. I propose a different way for the turn order to happen during the scene which enables players to have a more fluid and cinematic experience, I've dubbed it "Passing the Torch"

**STEP 1** Who Starts First? (Gaining the Torch)
When determining who side goes first, the players or the GM, all players must make an Initiative Check (1d20+DEX) against the TARGET. If an equal  amount or greater than the total number of players pass the check, they decide who goes first. Otherwise, the GM will be the one starting.

> There's nothing stopping the players deciding that the GM is the one to start the combat off

**STEP 2** Taking your turn (The Torch bearer)
Now that you've been chosen to take your turn, you take it per normal.

**STEP 3** (Passing the Torch)
Once you've had your turn, you then decide who goes next. You can choose either another player or the GM.  This cycle continues until everyone involved in encounter have taken their turn.

> If the GM has multiple monsters in the encounter, each monster must have a turn before the round is over.

The last person who takes their this round decides who starts first in the next round.
