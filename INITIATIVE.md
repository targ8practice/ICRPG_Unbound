# INITIATIVE (PASS THE TORCH)

Normally in ICRPG, the standard method of determining the turn order is for
everyone to roll a D20 and the highest person goes first then it continues clockwise around the table.

With the Pass the Torch method, the players all roll an Initiative check (D20 + DEX or WIS) against the TARGET. If an equal or greater than the amount of players pass the check, they decide who goes first also known as ‘Gaining the Torch’. Otherwise, the GM will be the first to act.

The initiative check can be made EASY or HARD in the following ways:

- The players ambush the Monsters

- The Monsters ambush the players

- Environmental  effects

Who ever gains the Torch will have their turn, after which they will then
**“Pass the Torch”** (Choose who goes next). This person can choose
another player or the GM. This cycle continues between players and GM
until everyone has taken their turn.

The last person (player or GM) who has the Torch this round decides who
starts with the Torch on the next round.

**Instinctive Reaction**: When you roll an Initiative check, you may add both your DEX and WIS stats to the roll. This will also count as 2 successes towards passing the group
check.
