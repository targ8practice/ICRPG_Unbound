# INITIATIVE (PASS THE TORCH)

With the Pass the Torch method, every player rolls an Initiative check (D20 + DEX or WIS) against the TARGET. If an equal or greater than the total amount of players pass the check, they decide who goes first also known as **'Gaining the Torch’**. Otherwise, the GM will be the first to act.

>The Initiative check can be made EASY or HARD in the following ways:
>- The players ambush the Monsters
>- The Monsters ambush the players
>- Environmental  effects

When ever you **'Gain the Torch'**, you will have your turn, after which you will then **“Pass the Torch”** (Choose who goes next). The Torchbearer can choose another player or the GM. This cycle continues until every player and NPC have taken their turn.

> If the GM has multiple NPC's on the field, each NPC must have a chance to act before the round is over.

The last person who **Gained the Torch** this round decides who starts with the Torch on the start of the next round.

*Example Ability Milestone*

**Instinctive Reaction**: When you roll an Initiative check, you may add both your DEX and WIS stats to the roll. This will also count as 2 successes towards passing the group
