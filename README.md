# Unbound
**An ICRPG Homebrew**

Welcome to Unbound, an ICRPG homebrew set of rule modules that will modify your ICRPG play experience. What these rules aim to achieve is to give you and your players some more options to use during your game sessions. You may note that there are some Example Ability Milestones. Players can choose to take these when a Milestone is given if they wish.

Currently the following rules modules have been written and ready for testing & feedback:
- [Status Effects](STATUS-EFFECTS.md)
- [Combat Checks](COMBAT-CHECKS.md)
- [Initiative](INITIATIVE.md)
- [Defense Stat rework](DEFENSE(ARMOR).md)


---

The other rules modules are still works in progress, but if you have any ideas would love the feedback!
