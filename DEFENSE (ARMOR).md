# DEFENSE (ARMOR)

The ARMOR stat is used to determine how much damage is reduced by when a successful attack is made against you. Simply add up all the LOOT you have that has an ARMOR value and that will give you the total amount. Most LOOT will only be useful to reduce damage taken from Physical attacks.

It should be notes that the amount of ARMOR a piece of LOOT also tells you how many slots in your inventory it takes up.

***Examples of Armor***
