# COMBAT CHECKS & ATTEMPTS (HYBRID ROLLING)

During combat, the player decides HOW they want to defend against the attack and roll
the appropriate STAT against the TARGET (this is calla a DEFENSE check).  As a GM you can decide if the roll is EASY or HARD (Usually LOOT will play a part in this or a Monster ability). 

If the player fails the roll, the GM will then either make the EFFORT roll to deal damage
to the player(s) or have some other effect take place.  Players can potentially reduce damage taken by an amount equal to their ARMOR Stat

Example Usages of
STATS when making a DEFENSE Check:

- STR – Use a  bladed weapon to parry the attack

- DEX – Dodge  and weave to avoid getting hit

- CON – Use  your body to take the hit and absorb the damage

- CHA – Use you  force of personality to resist a fear like effect

Note: Not all Stats can be used for a Defense check.

*Example Ability Milestones*

**Riposte:** If you use your Strength to successfully parry an attack made against you, deal WEAPON EFFORT back to the target

**Shield Bash**: If you use your Constitution to successfully block an attack
made against you, attempt a HARD STR CHECK place the CONCUSSION Status Effect on the target.

**Evade**: If you use your Dexterity to successfully dodge an attack made against you, shift your position without repercussion.
**Instinctive Reaction**: When you roll an Initiative check, you may add both your DEX and WIS stats to the roll. This will also count as 2 successes towards passing the group
check.
