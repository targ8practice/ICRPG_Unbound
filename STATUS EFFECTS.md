# STATUS EFFECTS

Status Effects are conditions that be placed on either PC’s or Monster’s, usually during a combat.

Unless you have a Milestone, Spell, Power, or LOOT related to a particular Status Effect, they are HARD to place. The duration of the Effect is always until the end of the targets turn unless you have something to increase it.

Here are some examples of Status Effects that can be placed upon a target. It is up to you as to how this is achieved (Usually by an Ability Milestone, LOOT, Spell or Power) but there’s nothing stopping you from getting creative.

* Blinded Target cannot see, any actions they take are HARD

*  Brittle The next person to successfully hit the target adds ULTIMATE to their damage

* Concussion Target has a 50% chance of not doing anything

* Confused Roll a 1d6 (1-2 Do nothing, 3-4 act normal, 5-6 attack a random target in range)

* Deafened Target cannot hear or benefit from effects that require hearing

* Disarm Target can only deal BASIC EFFORT until they take an ACTION to recover their weapon

* Forced Move Move the target

* Knockdown Target is knocked to the ground, all attacks that have CLOSE range are EASY against it.  Takes an ACTION to stand

* Paralysis Target cannot use any ACTION that involves moving and also can’t move.

* Restrained Target cannot MOVE, ACTIONS that involve attacking with a weapon are HARD

* Spell Suppression Target cannot use POWER or cast SPELLS

* Stunned You lose your turn and you drop anything you're holding

* Raise Gain a bonus to a check or attempt

* Lower Gain a penalty to a check or attempt

*Example Ability Milestones*

**Grappler** – Restrained, Knockdown & Forced Move status effects are not HARD to place.
**Expert Grappler** (Requires the Grappler Milestone) – The status effects gained from Grappler are EASY
